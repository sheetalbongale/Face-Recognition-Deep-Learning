Developed a face recognition system that can detect faces in images, identify the faces, and even modify faces with "digital makeup" like you've experienced in popular mobile apps.

## Project objectives
* Detecting faces in images
* Analyzing a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)
* Identifying faces in images
* Locating facial features in images
* Coding for face detection
* Finding lookalikes using face detection
* Generating face encoding automatically

Requirements:
```
- dlib==19.8.1
- face_recognition==1.2.2
- pillow
```
